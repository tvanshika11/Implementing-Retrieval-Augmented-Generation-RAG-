Large Language Models (LLMs) sometimes produce hallucinated answers and one of the techniques to mitigate these hallucinations is by RAG. For an user query, RAG tends to retrieve the information from the provided source/information/data that is stored in a vector database. A vector database is the one that is a specialized database other than the traditional databases where vector data is stored.

Vector data is in the form of embeddings that captures the context and meaning of the objects. For example, think of a scenario where you would like to get custom responses from your AI application.

First, the organization’s documents are converted into embeddings through an embedding model and stored in a vector database. When a query is sent to the AI application, it gets converted into a vector query embedding and goes through the vector database to find the most similar object by vector similarity search. This way, your LLM-powered application doesn’t hallucinate since you have already instructed it to provide custom responses and is fed with the custom data.

One simple use case would be the customer support application, where the custom data is fed to the application stored in a vector database and when a user query comes in, it generates the most appropriate response related to your products or services and not some generic answer. This way, RAG is revolutionizing many other fields in the world.

RAG pipeline
The RAG pipeline basically involves three critical components: Retrieval component, Augmentation component, Generation component.

Retrieval: This component helps you fetch the relevant information from the external knowledge base like a vector database for any given user query. This component is very crucial as this is the first step in curating the meaningful and contextually correct responses.
Augmentation: This part involves enhancing and adding more relevant context to the retrieved response for the user query.
Generation: Finally, a final output is presented to the user with the help of a large language model (LLM). The LLM uses its own knowledge and the provided context and comes up with an apt response to the user’s query.
These three components are the basis of a RAG pipeline to help users to get the contextually-rich and accurate responses they are looking for. That is the reason why RAG is so special when it comes to building chatbots, question-answering systems, etc.
